```

```

## Code Style

The classic [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) + [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) combo is used as Nest originally recommended. The configuration could be found at `.eslintrc.js` for both ESLint and Prettier as single source of truth. 

```bash
# manually lint the code base     
$ npm run lint

# while you can also do lint through IDE 
```
